# Prometheus Metrics

## Building
You'll need to prepare the subrepository _prometheus-cpp_ and will need to
follow up by performing the necessary steps as indicated by its repository,
located at [prometheus-cpp](https://github.com/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp).  

You'll need to perform the following:
```bash
submodule init
submodule update
```

and then you'd need to do the typical build steps that you'd usually undertake
with cmake.

## Docker
Upon success, docker images will be created for isolated testing and
demonstration.
